# cardstagram-front
Client side of my MERN stack application Cardstagram. Currently hosted on netlify https://cardstagram.netlify.app/


**USAGE**
The front-end currently has two routes: A landing page and a card creation form.

**LANDING PAGE**
Cards within the MongoDB will be displayed on the landing page. The searchbar allows the user to input a string which then searches for any card containing said string in it's "title" or "author" field.

**CARD CREATION PAGE**
Contains a form which allows the user to create a card. The required inputs are indicated as Title, Author and ImageURL. These inputs must be filled out before the card can actually be created via. form validation.
